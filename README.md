This project helps you installing RPM-Fusion and Flathub quickly on Fedora.

I suggest modifying the dnf.conf file before to make this process faster:

sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

add these lines below "skip_if_unavailable=True":

fastestmirror=True

max_parallel_downloads=10

defaultyes=True

There is a version which reboots your PC/laptop after installing the stuff mentioned above and one which doesn't reboot.
